TODO:
-Fix trump cards
-Add logic to consider which trump cards should be played (ask what the player has, then remember, takes enemy ai into account, asks if player held trumps changed after opponents turn)
^maybe can be modled if certain ai only plays certain trumps
Instead of    print(f" P. Play a trump card ({trump_count} in hand)")
 Auto suggest a trump card if necesary (play conservative to save from big damage and to survive later rounds/ harder opponents. Take into account what trumps the opponent likes to play and when. )

-Change challenge suggestions based on above logic
