TODO:
-Fix trump cards
-Add logic to consider which trump cards should be played (ask what the player has, then remember, takes enemy ai into account, asks if player held trumps changed after opponents turn due to ai trumps or player trumps. Recontinue probablity calculations after taking that into effect)
^maybe can be modled if certain ai only plays certain trumps
Instead of    print(f" P. Play a trump card ({trump_count} in hand)")
 Auto suggest a trump card if necesary (play conservative to save from big damage and to survive later rounds/ harder opponents. Take into account what trumps the opponent likes to play and when. )


-Change challenge mode/ suggestions based on above logic (remove Defeat an opponent despite being bust. option from menu) Just give instructions when at a high probability in survival/ survival+ if the challenge isnt already completed.
-- Trump unlocks that require different play styles:
Defeat an opponent despite being bust.	Starting Trump Card +1
Complete "Survival" without being tortured once.	Ultimate Draw
Complete "Survival+" without being tortured once.	Grand Reward

-add a notice that 21 base tutorial against lucas logic is currently not working properly
