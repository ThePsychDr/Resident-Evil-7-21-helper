TODO:
- dont suggest locked trump cards to add to current hand
- Test trump weight system 
>Make sure the weighing is taking the remaining cards in deck into account
> test recommendations in early game vs late game esp taking your current health/ trumps into account.
(adjust if new enemy behavior is obvserved)
- change Beat Survival without taking damage challenge in challenge lab to work with logic not just what to do. Recommend a run reset if put in a truly impossible situation.
- implementing beating survival+ without taking damage is uncessary at this point. (No rewards other than cosmetic)

-add suggestion to restart run if chances of a winning run/game drops to ~20% or less within the first 4 opponents in 21 + (try to implement locked challenges into this logic; Do not implement complete survival+ withought being tortured once challenge into this logic)
-prioritize defeating mr big head if he shows up (Until beat twice so Harvest is unlocked)

-figure out if Win a round using at least 15 trump cards is possible in survival or only survival+



Example (Normal 21) // What to change marked throughout (also apply these changes to 21+ if logic makes sense in both modes)

============================================================

 MODEL: Opponent AI draws until 16+.

 (Opponent hasn't stayed — odds are estimates. Select '2' when they stop drawing.)

 If YOU STAY now -> Win 53.2% | Tie 8.3% | Lose 38.5%.

 If YOU HIT now -> Win 37.7% | Tie 7.8% | Lose 54.6% (Bust draw chance: 62.5%).

TODO: (Dont show this if you dont have love your enemy) If you FORCE A DRAW (Love Your Enemy) -> Win 49.7% | Tie 9.5% | Lose 40.8% (busts opponent: 0%).
  (only show if possible with current bet/ trump cards. also take enemy previous action into account) If you BUST ON PURPOSE -> Best card: 5 (total 22) → Win 35.4%. [Completes bust-win challenge!]

 ACTION: STAY — your 17 likely meets/beats his ~16.

 OPPONENT TIP:
 Easiest opponent. No special trump cards.
